# wsgi-calc
Create a new github repository. Call it wsgi-calc.
Add a python script to it called calculator.py.
Your script should be runnable using $ python calculator.py
When the script is running, I should be able to view your application in my browser.
I should be able to see a home page that explains how to perform calculations.
